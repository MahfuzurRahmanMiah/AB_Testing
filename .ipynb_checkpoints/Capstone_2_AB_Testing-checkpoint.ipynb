    "For this project, I performed some exploratory analysis on stroke data. This dataset was found on Kaggle, uploaded by user SaumyaAgarwal and can be retrieved at this link: [Stroke Data](https://www.kaggle.com/asaumya/healthcare-dataset-stroke-data). The dataset we have executed our code on was downloaded on Sept 5th, 2019.\n",

    "The goal of our project was to investigate the relationship between incidence of stroke and other categorical knowledge about a patient. In this dataset, we have data about gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, marriage status, work type, residence type, glucose level BMI, smoking status and incidence of stroke. We are curious to see how these different measures relate to stroke incidence."
